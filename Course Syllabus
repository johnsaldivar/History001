Course Description:

“History’s for all, not just ‘historians’; but you have to KNOW something.” Mary Beard, Professor of Ancient Roman History, Cambridge University

“…it would not be objectionable to adopt some practical system by which the former slaves could lift themselves out of their old relation to their former masters. Education for young blacks and freedmen must be included in this plan” Abraham Lincoln 1863.

“Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world that that yields most painfully to change."  Robert F. Kennedy, 1968.

Welcome to History 001 – Introduction to Western Civilization Part 1.  This is a transfer-level course that will be taught with the same rigor as I have taught it in the past at UCLA and at CSULA and I hope that you will partner up with me in studying and educating ourselves about American history. 

I included the quotes that start this syllabus to emphasize first, how history is not some arcane "specialty" subject for people sitting in archives, but is in fact a subject for all people, since history is your story, the story of individuals, the story of people, and of people and societies and culture. Just like the stuff that has happened in your past impacts how you react to the present and how you think about the future - the stories we tell about our past inform our understanding of the present and impact our vision of the future. As such, this is a safe space for you to express your ideas, speak your truth, and engage with me and your fellow students about our society and culture - of course, to understand your history and everyone's history - you have to know not only what happened but also what didn't and how to tell the difference.

I also want to emphasize just how important Lincoln believed education would be for those who had been previously excluded from society and citizenship in becoming full members of society and gaining true and real freedom - the more educated you are, the more you know what your rights are and the more you know what your rights are, the harder it is for someone to take them away.

Finally, I also want to emphasize, in these and in all times, that nothing is not only more vital but also more empowering than moral courage - whether that is taking to the streets, standing up for what is right and calling out what is wrong, not just when it's easy but especially when it's hard, or getting into what the late John Lewis called "good trouble" - moral courage is what bends the "arc of history towards justice" as Dr. King believed occurred. And, the good news is, everyone is capable of moral courage - you don't have to be a super-genius, athletic superstar, or mega-talented entertainer... you just have to stand up and take a stand.

Congratulations to you for taking your next steps on your educational journey and towards the true and real freedom that comes with being an educated, active, and informed member of our society and of the American Experiment, which is, as Lincoln put it in his Gettysburg Address, whether "a nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal... can long endure" - and never forget, representative constitutional government IS an experiment, one that is not guaranteed to succeed - as you'll see when we look at how previous experiments failed and fell into tyranny in the Ancient Western World during the course of this class - and one that is currently undergoing one of its greatest survival tests in all its history as you take this class - the stakes are too high for you to just to be a spectator!

Remember, rights are really easy to take for granted and to surrender but history shows they are damn hard to get back once you've surrendered them! Knowing your rights is the first step in protecting and securing them...

Now, what are we going to partner up to study? During this intensive course, we'll not only examine what has come to be known as "Western Civilization" but the origins of the beliefs and traditions which characterize it. We'll also examine how these beliefs and traditions have been influential on both the various societies and cultures that are part of Western Civilization but also how those societies, cultures, and traditions have influenced American society in our modern 21st Century society - for good and for bad - and its ongoing evolution/devolution. As the humorist and philosopher Mark Twain once said: History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes!"

Through this class you're going to gain a far deeper understanding of where we are today and where we are going in the future by gaining a deeper understanding of our past - just like your past helps add context to your life: you know how you react to people, events, situations, and interactions is shaped by your personal history? Well, the same is true of society/culture/civilization in general as well.

Not only will you learn a little something about humans, humanity, and the nature of societies, traditions, cultures, civil rights and social justice but also gain a deeper understanding of the world in which you live and how it has been affected by traditions, influences, and change over time. Through this course, we'll learn together about all these ideas, events, tragedies, and triumphs as well as the context of why this current period and its controversies may very well threaten the American Experiment itself by looking at past experiments in representative governments, inclusive societies, and those who supported these ideas, opposed them, and what happens when rights are lost - or in societies where there's no cultural memories of having rights at all...

I look forward to you helping to educate me, yourselves, and each other to better understand not only Western Civilization but also our world and society and our community as you relate your history to the history of the societies, cultures, and individuals or Western Civilization and, if that wasn't cool enough, you'll also be able to impress and annoy your friends and family the next time you are watching an episode of Jeopardy, or are trying to win a trivia night contest at your local bar! ☺

Course Structure:

The structure of this course is divided into "units" each of which covers either a major historical period or society. The divisions correspond to major events or changes in society (like 9/11 for example). Each “unit” is contained in one of the course modules. Remember that this course covers 5000 years of history (give or take a decade!) so keeping up with the reading is very important - I was (and still am!) a "do things at the last minute" studier but, as someone who does that, let me say that this is a bad class to try to "cram" or do things at the last minute!

Each module contains lectures pertaining to each unit; discussion topics for you to comment on and interact about; and a "unit quiz" at the end of each unit about the materials found within each unit to help you measure progress in the course material as the semester goes along. All lectures, discussions, assignments, and quizzes in each unit will open in the module at the start of the unit, with the exception of the final lecture which will not open until the start of Week 15 to allow for any updates mandated by ongoing events - and I think we can all agree that, by the end of May, "stuff" will happen between now and then that you will "need to KNOW" as Professor Beard puts it in the quote at the top of this syllabus!

This structure will hopefully help clear up any confusion as to what is to be "covered" as the class progresses - especially since we are literally covering 5000 years of history in 15 weeks! Once "open", each module will remain available to you until just prior to the start of final exam week so that you can return to previous materials to make comparisons and to study for comprehensive assignments as the class progresses.

Some assignments that are "term assignments", like the Term Research Paper and the Final Exam are not included in any single module as they span the whole class, not just a single unit - they will be found under Assignments.

Course Objectives:

By the end of this course, you will be able to (1) assess a primary source document and contextualize it within its historical era and explain the importance of that document; (2) analyze the significance of change across time in history; and (3) analyze the varied impacts of historical issues on diverse groups within or between societies. By doing these things, you will get history from the words of those who made it and employ critical thinking and analysis about the topics we study.  

In addition, you will have a basic understanding of the developments of Western Civilization and the various cultures, beliefs, philosophies, scientific developments, societies, and governments that constitute it over the period from ca. 3500 BC-1660 AD, including:
1.    a basic understanding of the cultures, societies, and beliefs of the various civilizations of the Ancient Western World and the implications of the events of their histories on the development of the western tradition as well as on contemporary American society now, and in our future;
2.    a basic understanding of the cultures, societies, beliefs, and governmental structures of Classical Greek and Roman societies and the implications of the events of their histories, including the development, evolution, and decline of "democratic" and "republican" government, on the development of the western tradition as well as on contemporary American society now, and in our future, including how their governmental structures influenced the structure of American government and society and lessons on how they lost their representative governments relate to our current crisis which could cause us to lose ours;
3.    a basic understanding of the cultures, societies, beliefs, and traditions of Medieval European, Byzantine, and Imperial Islamic societies and the implications of the events of their histories on the development of the Western tradition as well as on contemporary American society now, and in our future;
4.    a basic understanding of the cultures, societies, beliefs, and traditions of Early Modern European societies and the implications of the events of their histories on the development of the Western tradition as well as on contemporary American society now, and in our future; and
5.    a basic understanding of how the western tradition has influenced the culture, beliefs, philosophies, scientific developments, and structures of our contemporary American society and how our contemporary American society fits into that western tradition; and
6.    a basic understanding of how the western tradition contributes to the origins of and has influenced the philosophy of the rights, responsibilities, and role that each of you plays as an active, educated, and informed citizen of this nation, with a sense of the history that informs and defines our society and culture.

Cheating Policy:
Cheating constitutes academic dishonesty and will be handled as part of the course grading process. Penalty may range from no credit for assignment up to and including exclusion and/or an "F" grade for the course.  All assignments will be checked for plagiarism - do not plagiarize! Any plagiarism will be considered as cheating and will result in no credit being given for the plagiarized assignment(s) along with additional sanctions up to and including exclusion and/or an overall "F" grade.

Class Requirements:

Please note - there are Discussions and Unit Quizzes scheduled throughout this class both to keep the class moving and break up the material to enhance your understanding of it.

Failure to participate in the First Discussion (both posting and responding to at least two other students' posts) OR to complete the "Week 1 Quiz" before the appropriate deadlines of each assignment will constitute grounds for being dropped from the class prior to the Monday February 20th census deadline. Failure to participate in subsequent discussions or complete, unit quizzes, paper assignments, or the midterm exam prior to the last day to drop Sunday May 7th will also constitute grounds for being excluded from the class by the professor. In addition, the Canvas "Activity Meter" will be in use in this class and students demonstrating that they are no longer active in the class will constitute grounds for being excluded from the class by the professor as well.

No late assignments will be accepted - It is your responsibility to make certain that submitted assignments (a) have been posted in a timely manner and (b) are posted in the proper format - no emoticons, ALL CAPS, online shorthand and/or internet slang (i.e. LOL), and/or code with no text will be accepted on exams or assignments. All assignments will be graded for spelling and grammar as well as content.

If you require assistance from DSP&S for assignments and/or examinations, please contact them at 323-265-8787 or at https://www.elac.edu/Student-Services/DSP-S (Links to an external site.) and have them confirm what assistance is appropriate so that proper accommodations can be made.

Discussion Participation - I'll post a discussion topic at the beginning of each unit about the topics that are part of that unit. Each unit will have two weeks of discussion. There will also be a final discussion in the last week of the class. You are required, at minimum, to log in and respond to those topics no later than the final Sunday of the unit (i.e. Weeks 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, and 15) prior to @ 11:59pm on the "Discussion Board" - Active participants and those interested in doing more than the minimum typically log in each week and contribute comments each week, building on their understanding of the historical topics contained in the unit and go beyond the minimum. Your postings to the Discussion Board will be graded for content - both of your original post and your responses to other students' posts – please note that minimum participation in the discussions require an initial post of your analysis of the topic(s) and at least two responses to your fellow students’ posts – you will not be able to respond to your fellow students’ posts until after you have submitted an initial post. The more thoughtful and innovative the posts and responses (as opposed to "I agree with you" with no further comment), the more likely you are to earn higher scores. There are 7 total discussions, each discussion is worth a maximum of 10 points – Discussion Participation is worth a total maximum of 70 points. In addition, there's an "Introductory Discussion" which is designed to get you used to the Discussion Board and interacting with your peers - it will be open until Monday February 13th @ 11:59pm and while participating in it is required, any points earned will be treated as extra credit. Students must participate in the discussions to be eligible to earn a passing grade in the class.
Unit Quizzes - To help measure progress and your understanding of the course as it goes along, each Unit has a Unit Quiz on the readings (both in the textbook as well as the posted lectures and any materials/links that are included in each unit) and materials which you'll take at the end of each unit.  Each Unit Quiz covers only the reading and materials pertaining to that unit. Each Unit Quiz will consist of approximately 24 fill-in and/or multiple choice questions, which will be timed at 60 minutes. Students will be allowed only one attempt on each Unit Quiz. There will be 6 Unit Quizzes which will be due by Sunday @ 11:59pm in the weeks they are assigned (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, and 14). Each of these Unit Quizzes are worth a maximum of 15 points. In addition, there'll be a Final Week Quiz (in Week 15) which will be shorter and due by the Sunday of Week 15. It is worth a maximum of 10 points. Overall, the 6 Unit Quizzes and the Final Week Quiz are worth a total maximum of 100 points. Students must take the Unit Quizzes to be eligible to earn a passing grade in the class. Please note that each Unit Quiz will have extra credit built into the quiz. No late quizzes will be allowed or accepted.
Primary Source Document Analysis Papers - Each of you will write two (2) Primary Source Document Analysis papers - one before the midterm and one after the midterm - based on a selection of primary source documents pertaining to particular topics covered in the class in which you'll not only examine the historical contexts of the documents but also present your comparative analysis and evaluation of the selected documents as well. No outside research is required for these papers. For the "Before the Midterm" paper, there will be 2 different options for these papers, from which you can choose which one (1) you want to do. The first option will be due on the Sunday of Week 3, the second option will be due on the Sunday of Week 5 - each of these options will be worth a maximum of 30 points. For the "After the Midterm" paper, everyone will do the same paper, which will be due on the Sunday of Week 11 and will be worth a maximum of 50 points (since you'll have feedback from your first paper to help guide you on your second paper) for a maximum total of 80 points overall. No late papers will be allowed or accepted and any plagiarism will result in the paper earning a grade of 0.
Midterm Examination - There will be an essay-based midterm exam during the "long" 7th week of the course (since week 8 is only 3 days long before Spring Break) that will cover all the course materials up to that point - Western Civilization from ca. 3500-31 BC. The midterm will consist of one essay question which will be timed at 100 minutes. You'll only get one attempt to complete the exam, once you open it, you'll have 100 minutes to write your essay on the question provided and submit the exam. It'll open on Tuesday March 21st and be due by Wednesday March 29th at 11:59 pm and will be worth a maximum of 100 points. This is meant to replicate a face-to-face class "bluebook exam" and thus is not an open book/open notes/open lectures exam. At least a week before the midterm exam opens, I'll distribute a study guide with approximately 5-6 potential midterm essay topics - one of which will be the essay question that will be on your midterm. No late midterms will be allowed or accepted and any plagiarism will result in the exam earning a grade of 0. Not taking the midterm exam will result in being dropped from the class or a grade of F for the course.
Comprehensive Final Exam - There will be a comprehensive final exam during the final week of the course which will cover the entirety of the course material – Western Civilization: ca. 3500BC-1660AD and all the readings and materials covered in the class. This exam will consist of one comprehensive essay question which will be timed at 120 minutes. You'll only get one attempt to complete the exam, once you open it, you'll have 120 minutes to write your essay on the question provided and submit the exam.  The final exam will open on Wednesday May 31st and will be due by Sunday June 4th @ 11:59 pm and will be worth a maximum of 150 points. This is meant to replicate a face-to-face class "bluebook exam" and thus is not an open book/open notes/open lectures exam. At least a week before the final exam opens, I'll distribute a study guide with approximately 5-6 potential final essay topics - one of which will be the essay question that will be on your final exam. No late finals will be allowed or accepted and any plagiarism will result in the exam earning a grade of 0. Not taking the final exam will result in a grade of F for the course as well.
Please make sure to make time to take the unit quizzes and midterm & final exams. All sections are timed, and you need to keep track of the time because if you go over the time limit, the site will automatically close and submit the quiz/exam even if unfinished.
Students must complete all required assignments to be eligible to pass the class.

6. OPTIONAL Term Research Paper - If you want to earn an A in the class, you must complete the Optional Term Research Paper. If you choose not to do the Optional Term Research Paper, the highest grade you can earn in the class is a B. After the midterm, I'll post a list of suggested potential topics regarding either Pandemics in the Ancient/Medieval World or the Decline of Representative Governments in the Ancient World for you to consider as your Term Research Paper project. You can either choose one of them or propose your own topic on these themes and send it to me for my review. Once you've chosen an approved topic, you'll compose a Term Research Paper that not only examines the historical context of the topic and the primary source documents which you'll research to tell your story about the topic, but also presents your analysis, opinion, and evaluation regarding your topic as well. The assignment will be posted in "Assignments" beginning at the start of the 9th week of the course (after Spring Break). It will be worth a maximum of 100 points, and it is due Wednesday May 17th at 11:59 pm. No late term papers will be allowed or accepted and any plagiarism will result in the paper earning a grade of 0.

Extra Credit – In addition to the "Introductory Discussion" described above, each of you must complete the “1st Week Quiz” which is designed to get you used to the format, timing, and pace of the Unit Quizzes on the course site – it will consist of 6 questions about the first week’s readings with a time limit of 15 minutes and is worth a maximum of 5 points, all of which will apply as extra credit. Like participation in the "Introductory Discussion", the “1st Week Quiz” is also due Monday February 13th @ 11:59pm. In addition, there is extra credit “built in” to each Unit Quiz. I also reserve the right to offer additional extra credit at my discretion during the semester. If additional extra credit is offered, it will be posted via "Announcements" at the course website and emailed to the students via the email that you have submitted to the course site.
Grading Policy:
Grading will be competency-based with no curve. Due to the optional term research paper, there are two different grade scales for the class. For those of you who choose to do the optional term research paper, there are 600 possible points and the scale is as follows:
520.0-600.0 = A
470.0-519.5 = B
420.0-469.5 = C
360.0-419.5 = D
Below 360.0 = F

For those of you who choose NOT to do the optional term research paper, there are 500 possible points and the scale is as follows (note - no A is possible if you choose not to do the term paper):
400.0-500.0 = B
350.0-399.0 = C
300.0-349.5 = D
Below 300.0 = F

No make-up exams or late assignments (after assignment "closes") will be accepted.

Please note that excessive absences are grounds for being dropped and/or excluded from classes at any time during the semester. Given that this course is taught online, the professor reserves the right to drop students who fail to actively participate in discussions, and/or fail to consistently log on to the course website over the course of the semester as these actions are, in courses whose contact hours are online, considered as excessive absences. If some situation does come up, send your professor a private message to explain - in all classes, keep your professors informed (as you would your boss at work) and give them a chance to be cool/understand!
The course ends on Sunday, June 4th, at 11:59 pm. The course site will be officially closed shortly after on Monday June 5th. 
Additional Notes:

The most efficient way to contact the professor is through the course website. The course website does have a "chat room" which is reserved for students to have a place to interact - this means that, while the instructor doesn't enter the "chat room", if you ask the professor a question in the "chat room", it is likely that the professor will never know about it or answer it. The professor will attempt to answer all messages within 48-72 hours.
The Canvas site does have a limited "like answers" program - in other words, spelling errors, like “Emanciptation Proclamation”, or filling in "Abe Lincoln" rather than "Abraham Lincoln" on a "fill-in" question on a Unit Quiz could initially be marked incorrect by the course site, and, apparently by the late, great Alex Trebek! (see:http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/08/05/watch-eight-grader-loses-final-jeopardy-round-due-to-misspelling/ (Links to an external site.)). Thus, all "fill-in" answers are reviewed by the professor and scores adjusted as appropriate - your grade is not "final" until the professor reviews the quiz and you get the "quiz has been evaluated and scores adjusted" message, usually the day after the unit quiz is due.

I HOPE YOU ALL ENJOY THE CLASS!!!

Note: Since the Canvas site counts extra credit points as part of "maximum points", when calculating your grade, keep in mind the scale is based on either 600 (with term paper) or 500 (without term paper) points, not what Canvas shows as the "possible" (which will incorrectly include the available extra credit). I'll make sure to provide updates every few weeks after I've graded assignments as to what the actual total possible points are.
